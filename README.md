## Why Scarlet?

Scarlet is self-hosted, meaning you have complete control of your group's data.  
There is no third party with access to your VRChat or Discord credentials or other sensitive information.  
Since there is no automatic synchronization of data between groups running Scarlet, you don't have to worry about other groups seeing who your group has moderated or what groups you are tracking.

Scarlet supports sending cli commands via named pipes.
Windows: `\\.\pipe\ScarletIPC-grp_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
Everything else (Unix-like): `/tmp/ScarletIPC-grp_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.sock`

```ps1
function Send-ScarletIPC
{
    param
    (
    [String]$GroupID,
    [String]$Message
    )
    $request = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($Message);
    $stream = New-Object -TypeName System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeClientStream -ArgumentList '.',"ScarletIPC-$GroupID",([System.IO.Pipes.PipeDirection]::Out),([System.IO.Pipes.PipeOptions]::None),([System.Security.Principal.TokenImpersonationLevel]::Impersonation)
    $stream.Connect(1000);
    $stream.Write($request, 0, $request.Length);
    $stream.Dispose();
}

Send-ScarletIPC -GroupID 'grp_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' -Message 'stop'
```

### Interoperability

Scarlet links to the official VRChat website whenever possible, including for user profiles, group posts, instances, and much more.  
Scarlet can generate a link that will autopopulate the fields of the VRChat Help Desk report form based on custom tags assigned to moderation events, streamlining the reporting process and reducing mistakes from human error.

---

### About Extended Events

Extended audit events (Instance Inactive, Staff Join, Staff Leave, Vote-to-Kick Initiated) are logged with the Discord command `set-audit-ex-channel`.  
Some of these require that a VRChat Client in a group instance must be running on the same machine in order for them to be logged in Discord channels.  
This limitation exists because Scarlet reads the VRChat client log file as it gets updated with information.  
At the moment, these events are not of the same degree as the canonical group audit events, as they do not have an , but similar functionality may hopefully be added to VRChat's first-party API in the future.

---

### About Actors and Targets

Actors are the users that *initiated or performed* an event, like a group staff member.  
Targets are the users that had an event *performed on them*, like the user a group staff member kicks from an instance.  
For some events, the target may not be a user, like for when a group instance is created.

## Installation

### Requirements

You will need:  
- A VRChat group you (or a dedicated bot account) have permissions for.  
- A Discord server (guild) in which you have permissions.  
- A Discord bot account (application).  
- A Windows PC with Java 8 installed.

If you wish to not install Java 8 for all users on the PC, if you would like to have several different Java installations, or if you would otherwise prefer to keep the Java 8 installation to Scarlet only, see the instructions further below.

### Setting up Discord Application

It is recommended that you create a bot account dedicated specifically for running Scarlet.  
Create a new application via the Discord developer dashboard: https://discord.com/developers/applications

Scarlet requires some permissions above the bare defaults:  
1. In the `Installation` tab for your app:  
    - Scarlet only supports installation for servers.  
      Ensure that only the `Guild Install` box is checked in the `Installation Contexts` area.  
      ![setup installation contexts](images/setup_installation_contexts.png?raw=true)  
    - In the `Guild Install` part of the `Default Install Settings` area:  
      - Add the `bot` scope.  
      - Add the `Attach Files`, `Create Polls`, `Create Public Threads`, `Embed Links`, `Manage Webhooks`, `Read Message History`, `Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, `Speak`, and `View Channels` permissions.  
        ![setup default install settings](images/setup_default_install_settings.png?raw=true)  
2. In the `Bot` tab:  
    - Enable the `Server Members` and `Message Content` intent in the `Privileged Gateway Intents` area.  
      ![setup privileged gateway intents](images/setup_privileged_gateway_intents.png?raw=true)  
3. Invite the bot to your server.  
4. In the `Installation` tab for your app, select the `None` option for the `Install Link` area.  
   ![setup install link](images/setup_install_link.png?raw=true)

---

### Setting up the VRChat Group

The VRChat account that Scarlet will use must have at least these permissions:  
- `Manage Group Member Data`  
- `View Audit log`  
- `View All Members`

At the moment, Scarlet does not enforce any moderation action against users.  
All such actions (e.g., kicking or banning a user) must be performed manually, but Scarlet provides some convenience methods like Discord commands and buttons.

### Installing the Scarlet Desktop Application

1. Download the latest release (`zip` is recommended): https://github.com/SybylineNetwork/Scarlet/releases/latest  
2. Copy or extract the files into the directory of your choosing.  
3. If you have Java 8 installed to the system PATH, skip this step.  
    - Download and extract a Java 8 JDK, such as this one from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&package=jdk&version=8).  
    - Create (or overwrite) the file `scarlet.home.java` next to `run.bat`.  
    - Copy-paste etc. the root path of the JDK to the **first line** of `scarlet.home.java` and save the file.  
4. If you want Scarlet to store data in a specific folder:  
    - Create (or overwrite) the file `scarlet.home` next to `run.bat`.  
    - Copy-paste etc. path of the desired directory to the **first line** of `scarlet.home` and save the file.  
5. Run the `run.bat`.
